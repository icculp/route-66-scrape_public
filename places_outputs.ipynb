In 1876 the fort was named by General Phil Sheridan, in honor of his friend Major General Jesse L. Reno, who was killed in the Civil War in 1863 at the Battle of South Mountain in Maryland. The cavalry and infantry stationed at Fort Reno played an important role in the transition of the area from Indian Territory status to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. United States Cavalry units, including the Buffalo Soldiers (Black soldiers of the 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry, and the 24th and 25th Infantry), and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Scouts, along with the U.S. Marshal Service, maintained the peace on the central plains until the turn of the century. In 1908, Fort Reno became one of three Army Quartermaster Remount Stations for the military, a role which it served through 1948. Specialized horse breeding and training of pack mules became the central focus of activity at Fort Reno. During World War II, 94-acres of an eastern portion of the Fort Reno lands served as an internment work-camp for German and Italian Prisoners of War. They were a part of General Rommel’s Afrikakorp captured in North Africa. in 1944, they built the Post Chapel located to the north of the Parade Grounds. The west side of the historic military cemetery is where seventy German and Italian Prisoners of War are interred.', 'image': 'https://www.historic66.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/14ab76a5bf03016bfcf5d4fa06f0a11f_.jpeg'}, 'Dome House': {'address': 'Rte 66\\nHinton, OK 73047', 'description': 'NULL', 'image': 'https://www.historic66.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/14353fae9434a44343150ad3f92b7ab9_.jpeg'}, 'Sid’s Diner': {'address': '300 S Choctaw Ave\\nEl Reno, OK 73036', 'description': 'NULL', 'image': 'https://www.historic66.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0d1258a82f54777f00f93e19da99f690_.jpeg'}, 'Murals of El Reno': {'address': '116 S Choctaw Ave\\nEl Reno, OK 73036', 'description': 'One of downtown El Reno’s walls is decorated with a 108-ft. wide mural showing the heritage of El Reno, Canadian County and western Oklahoma across nine panels.

The original owners, the Stroud Trading Company dedicated the second floor of the building as a lodge and operahouse in 1902. This was to respond to the growing interest in cultural things in the Territory. The operahouse operated here until 1925, when the area was remodeled and became the Liberty Hotel. The interior of the first floor has been completely remodeled. In 1917, the wooden floor was replaced with a concrete one.

The city was incorporated in 1918, and by 1920, Picher had a population of 9,726. Peak population occurred in 1926 with 14,252 residents. Mining ceased in 1967. The contaminated water from some 14,000 abandoned mine shafts, 70 million tons of mine tailings, and 36 million tons of mill sand and sludge remained as a huge environmental cleanup problem. As a result of national legislation to identify and remediate such environmentally hazardous sites, in 1980 the area was designated as part of the Tar Creek Superfund site.\",\n",
