A town site developed overnight around the new workings and was named Picher in honor of O. S. Picher, owner of Picher Lead Company. The city was incorporated in 1918, and by 1920, Picher had a population of 9,726. Peak population occurred in 1926 with 14,252 residents. Mining ceased in 1967. The contaminated water from some 14,000 abandoned mine shafts, 70 million tons of mine tailings, and 36 million tons of mill sand and sludge remained as a huge environmental cleanup problem. As a result of national legislation to identify and remediate such environmentally hazardous sites, in 1980 the area was designated as part of the Tar Creek Superfund site. \n",

That entry used to have spring-loaded screen doors, the kind that banged, bounced, and banged again when people came and went. The original 1915 gasoline pumps had glass containers on top so the attendant could measure how much gas went into the car. In their place now are two 1940s enamel pumps complete with the old geared system to indicate the flow of gas with clicking metal numbers. The signage that used to top the pole between the pumps is gone, but the old lights that once illuminated the front of the station are still in place. Except for a 1961 addition to the rear of the property, the station’s form is virtually unchanged from the way it looked when Allen Threatt built it. \n",

For the next 30 years, Vrana used the barn to store hay and as a work place. In 1977, the barn was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, but it was near the point of collapse. Luke Robison, a retired builder and carpenter, became aware of the barn’s plight and formed The Arcadia Historical and Preservation Society with his wife Anna and Beverly White. On May 27, 1988 Frank Vrana's descendants donated the barn to the Society. Before work could begin the roof collapsed on June 29, 1988. Restoration work continued. Much of the labor was performed by volunteers, mostly retirees like Robison, who called themselves the Over-the-Hill Gang. \n",

The store is also one of the few triangular buildings in Oklahoma City, as it occupies a corner lot in an area where Classen Boulevard cuts diagonally through the city's street grid. Due to its shape, the store was known as the Triangle Grocery from 1940 until 1948, when it became the Milk Bottle Grocery due to its new statue. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 1998. The Saigon Baguette, a Vietnamese bánh mì shop, occupied the space for several years. In August 2014 it was announced that the building would be restored to its original appearance. \n",

Reno, who was killed in the Civil War in 1863 at the Battle of South Mountain in Maryland. The cavalry and infantry stationed at Fort Reno played an important role in the transition of the area from Indian Territory status to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. United States Cavalry units, including the Buffalo Soldiers (Black soldiers of the 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry, and the 24th and 25th Infantry), and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Scouts, along with the U.S. Marshal Service, maintained the peace on the central plains until the turn of the century. In 1908, Fort Reno became one of three Army Quartermaster Remount Stations for the military, a role which it served through 1948. Specialized horse breeding and training of pack mules became the central focus of activity at Fort Reno. During World War II, 94-acres of an eastern portion of the Fort Reno lands served as an internment work-camp for German and Italian Prisoners of War. They were a part of General Rommel’s Afrikakorp captured in North Africa. in 1944, they built the Post Chapel located to the north of the Parade Grounds. The west side of the historic military cemetery is where seventy German and Italian Prisoners of War are interred. \n",

In 1876 the fort was named by General Phil Sheridan, in honor of his friend Major General Jesse L. Reno, who was killed in the Civil War in 1863 at the Battle of South Mountain in Maryland. The cavalry and infantry stationed at Fort Reno played an important role in the transition of the area from Indian Territory status to Oklahoma statehood in 1907. United States Cavalry units, including the Buffalo Soldiers (Black soldiers of the 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry, and the 24th and 25th Infantry), and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Scouts, along with the U.S. Marshal Service, maintained the peace on the central plains until the turn of the century. In 1908, Fort Reno became one of three Army Quartermaster Remount Stations for the military, a role which it served through 1948. Specialized horse breeding and training of pack mules became the central focus of activity at Fort Reno. During World War II, 94-acres of an eastern portion of the Fort Reno lands served as an internment work-camp for German and Italian Prisoners of War. They were a part of General Rommel’s Afrikakorp captured in North Africa. in 1944, they built the Post Chapel located to the north of the Parade Grounds. The west side of the historic military cemetery is where seventy German and Italian Prisoners of War are interred.', 'image': 'https://www.historic66.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/14ab76a5bf03016bfcf5d4fa06f0a11f_.jpeg'}, 'Muffler Man Art Installation by John Cerney': {'address': 'Route 66\\nEl Reno, OK 73036', 'description': 'A California-based artist conceived the cutout paintings of Muffler Men that were erected along Route 66', 'image': 'https://www.historic66.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/e4a27ca7470272054ea42d56cb0e0d71_.jpeg'}, 'Old Oil Station': {'address': 'US-270\\nCalumet, OK 73014', 'description': 'NULL', 'image': 'https://www.historic66.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7dba1679ea68f5417f7cce35bbf3ce70_.jpeg'}, 'Pony Truss Bridge': {'address': 'OK-8\\nGeary, OK 73040', 'description': 'Scheduled for refurbishment, this bridge was built in 1932 and 1933, but did not open until 1934.
